**Delivery state:** Pre-pilot MVP hardening; not yet approved for customer delivery

This file is the continuously maintained source of truth for product status,
accepted capabilities, delivery blockers, and ordered work. Detailed execution
evidence belongs in `ai-ledger/`. Durable product philosophy belongs in
`docs/ai/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` and `decision-register/`.

## 1. Executive Summary

Mpango is beyond prototype stage. The wholesaler ERP, tenant isolation,
financial invariants, credential lifecycle, deterministic test gate, retailer
identity, supplier-scoped retailer login, catalog/order workspace, and
read-only retailer finance visibility are materially implemented.

The current product is still pre-pilot because the retailer payment declaration
and confirmation loop, printable business documents, final workspace polish,
real-mailbox browser journey, customer HTTPS deployment, formal DB-OPS package,
tenant branding, and current user manuals are not all closed.

Current engineering truth:

- The wholesaler remains the primary customer and value owner.
- A retailer operates inside one selected wholesaler relationship at a time.
- Mpango does not expose a cross-supplier comparison workspace.
- Retailer catalog, negotiated price, orders, payments, and balances are scoped
  by the contextual JWT, active binding, and tenant schema.
- Retailer finance is currently read-only. No client route can settle a
  payment, mutate a ledger, or alter receivables.
- A merged SHA is not a deployed SHA. Runtime delivery requires exact-SHA
  deployment evidence.

## 2. Product Position

### Primary value owner

The wholesaler is the primary customer and future payer. Mpango helps a
wholesaler operate orders, inventory, payments, receivables, reporting, staff
permissions, and a private downstream retailer channel.

### Retailer role

The retailer is an invited operational participant. Retailer UX reduces order
friction and improves wholesaler throughput and retention; it must not turn
Mpango into a retailer-facing price-comparison marketplace.

A retailer may have independent relationships with multiple wholesalers, but:

- each relationship has a private catalog, negotiated price, order, payment,
  receivable, and operational context;
- one wholesaler cannot read another wholesaler's data;
- retailer login selects one supplier portal and receives one contextual JWT;
- the product does not generate a cross-supplier comparison view;
- Mpango cannot prevent a human from manually sharing information they already
  know, but it must not aggregate or disclose that information for them.

The positioning decision is recorded in
`decision-register/2026-07-23_wholesaler-private-channel-positioning.md`.

### Platform operator role

Platform operators maintain service health, tenant lifecycle, support,
backups, restores, incidents, and controlled operations. They are not ordinary
tenant users. Early pilot customers may be manually onboarded and supported;
subscription billing is outside the current MVP.

## 3. Branch and Environment Map

| Item | Current truth |
|---|---|
| Product baseline | `origin/product-dev-recovered@0f9d259b` |
| Main | `origin/main@134ea59e`, not promoted |
| Platform historical branch | `origin/platform-dev@12c5ee55`, not the active product baseline |
| Alembic head | `036_retailer_mvp_identity` |
| Windows default workspace | Dirty; read-only for controlled work |
| Controlled work | Clean isolated worktrees only |
| Tencent mainland VPS | Development, validation, or disaster-recovery role |
| Customer MVP hosting | Non-mainland HTTPS environment remains to be selected and closed |

Every runtime task must verify the deployed SHA independently. Do not infer
deployment state from a merged branch.

## 4. Capability Status

| Area | Status | Current truth |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant isolation | Strong foundation | Schema-per-tenant, validated identifiers, contextual JWTs, and binding guards |
| Wholesaler authentication | Implemented | Login, tenant selection, setup/reset, and terminal-token handling |
| Credential email links | Source complete; runtime pending | Absolute fragment links and query rejection are merged |
| Users and RBAC | Implemented | Tenant roles exist; retailer permissions are isolated as `client:*` |
| Orders | Implemented and hardened | State, financial, ownership, and cross-retailer boundaries are regression-covered |
| Payments | Financially hardened | Canonical methods, idempotency, replay, partial payment, and ledger invariants |
| Receivables | Financially hardened | Non-negative exposure and collection semantics protected by migration `035` |
| Inventory and catalog | Core capability present | Retailer catalog and order workspace are supplier-scoped |
| Reporting and exports | Implemented | Supported provisioning and sanitized worker/runtime boundaries |
| Retailer identity S1 | Merged | Invitation, setup/reset, verified email, authoritative mapping, migration `036` |
| Retailer private login S2 | Merged | One supplier portal, one contextual JWT, no `available_tenants` |
| Retailer workspace S3-S1 | Merged | Catalog/order ownership hardening and exact route/RBAC contracts |
| Retailer finance S3-S2 | Merged | Read-only payment history and server-authoritative relationship balance |
| Retailer payment declaration | Not implemented | Must not create canonical financial effects before cashier confirmation |
| Printable business records | Incomplete | Payment declaration, confirmed receipt, order, and statement print contracts remain |
| Retailer workspace closure | In progress | Payment workflow and final responsive/brand UX remain |
| Retailer end-to-end S4 | Not closed | Real mailbox and browser journey on deployed latest SHA remains |
| Platform operator schema | Foundation merged | Migration `034` tables exist |
| Platform operator runtime | Incomplete | Dedicated login/JWT/guard/frontend lifecycle remains |
| DB operations | Partial | Evidence exists, but one approved access/backup/restore/monitoring package remains |
| Tenant branding | Not implemented | Legal profile, logo, dual branding, and controlled configuration remain |
| User manuals | Incomplete | Wholesaler, retailer, and operator guidance must match deployed behavior |
| AI-native operations | Planned | Requires trustworthy data, permissions, approvals, audit, and rollback first |

## 6. Latest Validation Snapshot

The S3-S2 source candidate was validated twice on independent fresh PostgreSQL
16 and Redis 7 stacks:

| Metric | Run A | Run B |
|---|---:|---:|
| Passed | 3030 | 3030 |
| Skipped | 48 | 48 |
| XFailed | 15 | 15 |
| Failed | 0 | 0 |
| Errors | 0 | 0 |

Frontend source validation passed 16 files and 148 tests, followed by a
successful production build.

The reviewed source
`kilo/dc12r1-s3-s2-read-only-retailer-finance-2026-07-30@b56ae841`
was merged with `--no-ff` as:

`0f9d259b4a6c20584721c53b59ba94c510d1970d`

Post-merge verification on fresh PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 reached sole
Alembic head `036`, passed the S3-S1/S3-S2 backend bundle (`50 passed`),
passed the focused frontend bundle (`6 passed`), and completed a production
frontend build. Scoped pre-commit and secret detection passed.

This proves the merged source tree. It does not prove customer deployment or a
real browser/mailbox journey.

## 7. Current Delivery Blockers

### P1 product journey blockers

1. A retailer cannot yet submit a non-authoritative payment declaration for
   wholesaler review.
2. A wholesaler cashier cannot yet confirm or reject that declaration through a
   dedicated maker-checker workflow.
3. A retailer cannot yet see a confirmed receipt/rejection result and print the
   related business record.
4. The complete retailer workspace is not yet closed on mobile and desktop.
5. The latest SHA has not passed the full invitation/setup/reset/login/order/
   payment/finance journey through a real mailbox and browser.

### P1 operational blockers

1. The intended non-mainland customer HTTPS environment is not yet canonical.
2. DB access, backup, restore, monitoring, retention, incident response, and
   safe AI-agent actions are not one approved DB-OPS package.
3. Dedicated platform operator runtime authentication is incomplete.
4. User manuals and operator runbooks do not yet match final deployed behavior.

### Important but later

- Subscription and billing automation.
- Multi-warehouse expansion.
- Retailer staff sub-roles such as buyer, inventory clerk, and finance
  reconciler.
- Automated KYC and self-service tenant branding.
- SMS or WhatsApp transaction notification delivery.
- AI-native conversational mutations.

## 8. Ordered Work Plan

### Stage 1: Complete the retailer MVP loop

#### DC-12R1-S3-S1 - catalog and order hardening (completed)

Merged in the product history leading to `44ec07ff`. Catalog/order reads and
writes are supplier-scoped, use authoritative identities, and preserve the
retailer permission boundary.

#### DC-12R1-S3-S2 - read-only retailer finance (completed)

Merged as `0f9d259b4a6c20584721c53b59ba94c510d1970d`.

Delivered:

- read-only `GET /api/v1/client/payments`;
- read-only `GET /api/v1/client/finance/balance`;
- dual-key supplier/retailer predicates;
- server-authoritative Decimal balance;
- status-aware cash labels;
- no payment write, ledger, settlement, or receivable mutation.

#### DC-12R1-S3-S2B-D - payment declaration contract (next)

This is a design/audit gate before implementation because it introduces a new
financial workflow.

The contract must define:

- a retailer declaration as non-authoritative evidence, not a canonical
  payment;
- cashier confirm/reject as the only transition that may invoke the canonical
  payment write path;
- exact idempotency, concurrency, overpayment, replay, and maker-checker rules;
- immutable status history and rejection reason boundaries;
- retailer-visible pending/confirmed/rejected states;
- confirmed receipt versus unconfirmed declaration terminology;
- printable order, declaration, receipt, and account-statement requirements;
- event hooks for future SMS/WhatsApp without implementing delivery;
- an explicit decision to remove, retain, or replace the currently unused
  `client:payments:create` permission;
- migration requirements, rollback/forward-fix strategy, and an
  implementation/test matrix.

No product code or migration is authorized in the design gate.

#### DC-12R1-S3-S2B - payment declaration implementation (held)

Implementation begins only after the CTO approves the design gate. A submitted
declaration must have zero effect on order status, payment rows, ledger entries,
or receivable balances until cashier confirmation succeeds atomically through
the approved canonical financial path.

#### DC-12R1-S3-S3 - workspace and print closure

Deliver responsive retailer navigation, branded relationship context, clear
financial state language, printable documents, empty/error states, logout
recovery, and focused accessibility tests.

#### DC-12R1-S4 - end-to-end delivery closure

Deliver fresh migration, real invitation and credential email, browser login,
catalog, order, declaration, cashier confirmation, retailer receipt visibility,
printing, two-wholesaler isolation, and sanitized runtime evidence.

### Stage 2: Establish human-plus-AI DB operations

- Named human and AI-agent responsibility matrix.
- Least-privilege production access and break-glass process.
- Encrypted backup policy, retention, and restore drill.
- Migration preflight, maintenance mode, and rollback decision tree.
- Database health, storage, backup-age, and error monitoring.
- Incident ledger and prohibition on direct business-data edits outside
  approved replayable artifacts.

### Stage 3: Tenant identity, branding, and onboarding UX

- Legal/business profile and controlled operator review.
- Logo validation and safe asset storage.
- Mpango plus tenant dual-brand entry experience.
- Controlled asset replacement and configuration UX.
- Current wholesaler, retailer, and operator manuals.

Manual operator review is acceptable for the first one or two pilot
wholesalers. Automated billing and automated KYC are not pilot prerequisites.

### Stage 4: Non-mainland pilot deployment

- Region selected for Kenyan latency, reliability, support, and legal fit.
- Customer domain, DNS, TLS, backups, monitoring, and alert ownership.
- Exact-SHA deployment and rollback proof.
- One or two controlled wholesaler pilots with named support contacts.

### Stage 5: AI-native operating layer

Start only after reliable operational data and action boundaries exist.
Initial capabilities should be read-only assistance, guided data entry,
anomaly summaries, and approval-required typed actions. No unrestricted SQL,
shell, payment mutation, or tenant impersonation.

## 9. Role and Ownership Model

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| CTO/Codex | Architecture, scope, risk, contracts, merge, release verdict, project truth |
| Product coding agent | Bounded implementation/design slices on isolated branches |
| Independent Lubuntu validator | Fresh DB, full-suite, cross-environment, and browser evidence |
| OPS agent | Deployment, DNS/TLS, backup/restore, monitoring, and runtime evidence |
| Human owner | Credentials, mailbox, domain, legal data, and production authorization |
| Wholesaler pilot owner | Business workflow acceptance and operational feedback |

No agent's self-reported PASS is sufficient by itself.

## 10. Non-Negotiables

- No cross-tenant or cross-supplier disclosure.
- No client-supplied wholesaler or retailer authority.
- No payment declaration represented as received or settled.
- No canonical financial mutation outside the approved atomic payment path.
- No negative receivable exposure represented as valid customer debt.
- No query-string credential tokens.
- No silent schema repair inside a read-only validation gate.
- No dirty-worktree merge or deployment.
- No hidden skip, xfail, deselection, or assertion weakening.
- No secrets, credentials, raw exceptions, or private row contents in reports.
- No protected push without explicit human approval.
- No claim that merged code is deployed without exact runtime SHA proof.

## 11. Document Maintenance

Update `docs/ai/CTO_CURRENT_OPS.md` after every meaningful active-task change.
Update this file when the product baseline, migration head, accepted feature
stage, delivery blocker, deployment role, roadmap, or product trust decision
changes.

Do not append raw transcripts. Replace stale status with current facts.
Historical command output belongs in `ai-ledger/`.
